# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Ignore generated documentation.
/doc

# Ignore music daemon PID file
/lib/music/server.rb.pid

# Ignore compiled assets: They are generated by the application:
/public/assets

# Call to find_executable generates a mkmf.log file (I don't know why)
mkmf.log

# Ignore music db images
public/artists_images/*
